A Power BI dashboard I created as an example. 

The first page is designed to track the KPI 'Adherence' (ADH), which measures an employee's adherence to their scheduled work hours. A KPI, or Key Performance Indicator, is a quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an organization or individual in achieving specific goals
